control allocation and deallocation of memory
Dynamic Memory Management
performed with the operators new and delete
new, to dynamically allocate (i.e., reserve) the exact same amount of memory required at execution time
the object or built-in array is created in the free store (aldo called the heap) 
heap, a region of memory assigned to each program for storing dynamically allocated objects.
delete operator to deallocate (i.e., releasse) the memory

Obtaining Dynamic Memory with new
Time* timePtr{new Time}
delete timePtr

Initializing Dynamic Memory
double *ptr{new double{3.14159}}; //assigns the resulting pointer to ptr
Time* timrPtr{new Time{12, 45, 0}}: //arguments to an objectâ€™s constructor

Dynamically Allocating Built-In Arrays with new[]
int* gradesArray{new int[10]{}};

Releasing Dynamically Allocated Built-in Arrays with delete[]
delete[] gradesArray;
