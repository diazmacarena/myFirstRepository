Explain the use of the operators new and delete.
new, to dynamically allocate (i.e., reserve) the exact same amount of memory required at execution time.
the object or built-in array is created in the free store (aldo called the heap) 
heap, a region of memory assigned to each program for storing dynamically allocated objects.
delete, operator to deallocate (i.e., releasse) the memory.


You can control the allocation and deallocation of memory in a program for objects and for
arrays of any built-in or user-defined type. This is known as dynamic memory management and is
performed with the operators new and delete.
